Project Introduction:  
The map is to recommend nearby dog-friendly places for a dog person. We have dog-friendly restaurants, dog services and dog runs locations.
Clicking on the map, and you would get the nearest five dog-friendly places. You can also change the view of the map using control and your mouse, to see nearby buildings.  
In New York City overall, there are around 500 restaurants where you can bring your dog, around 450 pet clinics and hospitals for dog care, and around 90 dog-walking parks for weekend fun with your buddies.
